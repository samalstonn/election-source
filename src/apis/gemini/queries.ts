    Act as a diligent and thorough researcher to gather detailed, accurate, and up-to-date election information. 
    Your task is to provide comprehensive details about the below election.
    Please verify every detail carefully; if any information cannot be confirmed as accurate or is not available, mark it as "N/A."

    Election Details (use the following JSON template for election-level information):
    state: ${election.state},
    district: ${election.district},
    description: ${election.district},
    date: ${election.date.toISOString().split('T')[0]}

    Next, list all positions up for election as an array of JSON objects. 
  {
    "state": ${election.state},
    "district": ${election.district},
    "description":  ${election.district},
    "date": ${election.date.toISOString().split('T')[0]}
    "positions_up_for_election":   
      [
    "position list goes here"
      ]
  }
    Each position object must strictly follow this format WITH NO EXCEPTIONS:

    {
    "position_name": "Position name (e.g., 'Mayor', 'Council Member', 'County Circuit Court Judge - Branch 41')",
    "city": "City where the election is taking place (if it is a state or federal election, put 'N/A')",
    "state": "State where the election is taking place (if it is a federal election, put 'N/A'). Make sure the state is NOT in abbreviated form (eg. NOT NY or PA).",
    "description": "Brief description of the role and its responsibilities",
    "position_type": "Categorize the position as 'local', 'state', or 'federal'",
    "positions": "Number of seats up for election"
    }

    Important Instructions - Read before proceeding:
    - Accuracy First: Take your time and double-check all election details. Make sure to double check dates.
    - Clear Indications: Only mark any unverified or unavailable information as "N/A."
    - Structured Format: Present the output EXCLUSIVELY in JSON format following the exact schema provided above.
    - Follow Format: Do not include any additional details such as constitutional amendment voting, other key dates or resources, or information on elections in other states.

    IMPORTANT: Please ONLY respond with the valid JSON object, NOTHING ELSE. Your response must be valid, parseable JSON.
